        "\n",
        "The __call__ method in Python enables instances of a class to be called as if they were functions. When an object is called (e.g., obj()), Python automatically invokes the __call__ method defined within the object's class. This provides a way to create objects that behave like functions, offering greater flexibility and expressiveness in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is part of Python build-in methods also called dunder or magic methods because have two prefixes and suffix underscores in the method name. The main idea of __call__ method is to write a class and invoke it like a function. You can refer to it as callable object."
